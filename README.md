	<h1>README for LinkedIn Repository</h1>
	<p>This Python script extracts the top trending repositories from GitHub, saves the information to a text file, and displays a progress message for each topic.</p>
	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
	<p>To use this script, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine, as well as the Requests and Beautiful Soup libraries. You can install these libraries using pip by running the following commands in your terminal:</p>
	<pre>
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
	</pre>
	<h2>Usage</h2>
	<p>To run the script, simply execute the following command in your terminal:</p>
	<pre>python main.py</pre>
	<p>The script will create a file named 'github_trending.txt' in the same directory as the script, and will write the top trending repositories on GitHub, along with their links and about sections (if available), to that file. It will also display a progress message for each topic.</p>
